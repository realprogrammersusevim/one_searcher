![](https://www.pngkit.com/png/full/347-3472193_tengwar-text-of-the-one-ring-transparent-in.png)

*One searcher to search them all, one searcher to find them, one searcher to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.*

## Description

Everyone loves debate, right? But you know what sucks? Having to search a bunch of different websites for information. What if you could just use a single tool to search everything at once? Introducing the One Searcher to search them all.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Installation

As of yet I haven't created an executable for this, so run it as a Python script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realprogrammersusevim/one-searcher.git
cd one-searcher
./search <search term>
```
